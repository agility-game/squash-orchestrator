# Squash Test Management

[Squash](https://www.squashtest.com/?lang=en&utm_source=dockerhub&utm_medium=link) is an open-source test management tool. It is designed to manage requirements / user stories and test cases, to plan test campaigns, to track test executions.
Squash supports manual and automated tests. It can be used for any lifecycle: agile (Scrum, SAFe…) or V-model, build and/or run phase…
Squash can be integrated with requirement / user story repositories, bug trackers, automated test frameworks and studios, and any CI/CD pipeline. The full integration list is available [here](https://www.squashtest.com/squash-integrations?lang=en&utm_source=dockerhub&utm_medium=link).
